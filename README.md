modern-frontend-starter-kit
===========================

## Description

This is the boilerplate for the modern frontend.
It is not meant to be used with some kind of Node.js backend
(it is not isomorphic). The only purpose of this project is
to get frontend part of the web-application started easily.

This project is meant to be used with some kind of backend,
that will serve the main `index.html` file from the build
folder.

It uses:
* The React as the library for client-side UI.
* TypeScript as the language in which all the code is written
(except the build system).
* Gulp.js as the task runner.
* Yarn as a package manager.
* The Karma.js framework for testing

The project structure is described in [this document](docs/project_structure.md).

## Documentation

All the documentation of the project lies in the
[documents directory](docs). The code is also documented well.
